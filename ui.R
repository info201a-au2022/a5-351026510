In both China and India, the CO2 emissions present rising trends; whereas , the CO2 emission of the U.S. started to decrease in 2005. Despite the huge increase in CO02 emissions, all countries have decreasing trends for their CO2 per unit energy, which could indicate a global electricity consumption increase. A decline in CO2 per capita suggests that the U.S. may have an increasing CO02 emission and/or a decreasing population, which could be opposite situations for India and China.")
